# surfs_up_analysis

# Project Overview
The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable all year around. The way we get the temperature data is by running two seperate queries, one being for June and the other being December. Once we run our queries we store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics by using the describe method. Here is what we found:

## Results

For the month of June, we gathered temperature data from the years 2010 to 2017.

There was a total of 1700 temperatures recorded over the course of the 8 years. The average temperature for the month of June was roughly about 75 degrees farenheight. Rarely, the lowest temperature would reach around 64 degrees and the highest temperature would be 85 degrees farenheight.

For the month of December, we gathered temperature datas from the years 2010 to 2016.

There was a total of 1517 temperatures recorded over the course of the 5 years. The average temperature for the month of December was around 71 degrees farenheight. Rarely, the lowest temperature would reach 56 degrees farenheight and the maximum temperature would reach 83 degrees farenheight.

## Conclusion

With the the two sets of data, it is possible to operate a surf shop all year round. The two lowest temperature recorded may be evening temperatures. The two data sets only have them broken down by day, not by time. We would not be able to pinpoint what time exactly those temperatures were recorded. But with the tropical climate and the average temperatures are between 71 to 75 degrees, that is perfect weather to operate surf shop all year round.
